About me: I am a graduate from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. After completing my BSc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, I have done an MS in Biomedical Engineering. I am a research enthusiast in the field of Data Science. At present, I am looking for a fully funded MSc program in Artificial Intelligence and preparing myself for Data Analysis job as well. I hope everything works out just fine.
